#### Project Description
This project is a simulated game of Blackjack. It uses multiple classes, enums, and methods to accomplish making 
a fully functioning game. The user is able to play one on one against the deal, or against multiple other AI 
players.

#### How to Run This Program
When the game first launches, the user is prompted to enter their name, followed by the amount of additional AI 
players they would like to play with. The user will then input the names of each additional player. After that,
the players will place bets and the dealer deals cards. Next, the player takes their turn, they can choose to hit
or stay. The AI players will then take their turn, and finally the Dealer will take his turn. The winner will 
then be decided and the pot will be payed out to the winner. The user will then be prompted to whether or not
they would like to continue playing or not.

If an AI player has no money left, they will be booted from the game. If the user has no money left they will 
receive a game over.

#### Lessons Learned
This project was very fun for me to work on. I did not have much trouble implementing the necessary requirements, 
however, when I got to some of the stretch goals it became challenging. The hardest part for me was when I had to 
decide the winner and their pay out. I ended up re-writing a good chunk of the code to make this part work. In 
the end, I believe that it was the right move. The code is better organized and works better.
